# WooCommerce Playground Blueprint Worker

This Cloudflare Worker serves as a dynamic blueprint generator for testing WooCommerce releases in WordPress Playground. It provides a JSON configuration that automatically installs and configures WooCommerce with predefined settings.

## Purpose

The worker is designed to work with WordPress Playground (https://playground.wordpress.net) to create reproducible WooCommerce testing environments. It generates a blueprint that:

- Installs a specified WooCommerce release
- Configures pretty permalinks
- Sets up basic store information
- Skips the onboarding wizard
- Configures basic WooCommerce settings

## Usage

### Basic Usage with WordPress Playground

To test a specific WooCommerce release:

```
https://playground.wordpress.net/?blueprint-url=https://woocommerce-worker.briancoords-com.workers.dev/?release=9.8.0-beta.1
```

Replace `9.8.0-beta.1` with any WooCommerce version you want to test. The release must match the tag on Github.

### Default Release

If no release is specified, the worker will use 'latest':

```txt
https://playground.wordpress.net/?blueprint-url=https://woocommerce-worker.briancoords-com.workers.dev
```

### Direct JSON Access

You can also access the JSON blueprint directly:

```txt
https://woocommerce-worker.briancoords-com.workers.dev/?release=9.8.0-beta.1
```

## Deployment

1. Install Wrangler:

```bash
npm install -g wrangler
```

2. Login to Cloudflare:

```bash
wrangler login
```

3. Deploy the worker:

```bash
wrangler deploy
```

## Blueprint Configuration

The blueprint configures the following:

- **Store Location**: Poland (Wrocław)
- **Currency**: PLN (Polish Złoty)
- **Measurement Units**: 
  - Weight: Ounces (oz)
  - Dimensions: Inches (in)
- **Payment Methods**: Check payments enabled
- **Tracking**: Disabled
- **Onboarding**: Skipped for faster testing

## Development

The worker consists of two main files:

- `worker.js`: Contains the main logic and blueprint template
- `wrangler.toml`: Cloudflare Worker configuration

To modify the blueprint, edit the template object in `worker.js`.
